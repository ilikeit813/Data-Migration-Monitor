Given txt files (user defined, or use examples under /data/) and dvHeader.txt (code requirement), davis.py will open a browser by command:

bokeh serve --show davis.py

The code will generate a scatter plot which user can pick/circle data points and change plot column to see data migration and also show the x, y column trend charts. The code was inspired by Bokeh's gallery:
